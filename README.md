# Project Summary

In this project, we'll introduce how to use axios inside of a React project. We'll cover full CRUD in this project ( GET, PUT, POST, DELETE ) and also cover how to use .then(). Majority of the React application will already be built for you. If you're finding it hard to dive into an existing code base and understand exactly what is going on, that's perfectly normal. Try to focus only on how we're interacting with the API using axios.

This project is also incorporating toast notifications to help visualize successful or failed API requests. Therefore when building out our axios requests, we will add an additional line of code for successful and failed API requests.

* Success: `ToastStore.success('Success!', 3000);`
* Failure: `ToastStore.error('Failed!', 3000);`
